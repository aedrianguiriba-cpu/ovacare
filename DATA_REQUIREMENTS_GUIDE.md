# Data Requirements: How Many Logs Do You Need?

## Quick Answer

✅ **Start seeing results immediately with 1 log**  
📊 **Get meaningful data with 3-5 logs**  
📈 **Get accurate risk assessment with 6+ logs**  
🎯 **Full accuracy after 6 months of menstrual cycle tracking**

---

## Symptom Logs Requirements

### Symptom Tracking - IMMEDIATE (1+ logs)

**Minimum:** 1 symptom log  
**Better:** 5-10 logs  
**Optimal:** 30+ logs (analyzed from most recent)

**How it works:**
- System analyzes your **last 30 symptom entries**
- Counts **severe symptoms** (severity rating ≥ 6)
- Identifies **PCOS-specific patterns** (acne, bloating, hair, mood, cramps)
- Calculates risk contribution

**Scoring:**
```
1 symptom logged → Risk calculation starts
5 symptoms → Pattern detection begins
15 symptoms → Good pattern visibility
30+ symptoms → Full 30-day analysis window
```

**Example:**
```
After 1 log: Basic symptom recorded
After 5 logs: Can see if certain symptoms repeat
After 15 logs: Clear patterns emerging
After 30 logs: Comprehensive analysis possible
```

## Cycle Tracking Requirements

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Cycle Needs 6 Months for Accuracy

**Minimum:** 2 cycle entries (35-36 days)  
**Developing:** 3-4 cycles (3-4 months)  
**Confident:** 5+ cycles (5+ months)  
**Optimal:** 6+ cycles (6+ months)  
**Highly Accurate:** 7+ cycles (7+ months)

**Status Changes:**
```
< 2 cycles      → No assessment
2 cycles        → Very limited assessment
3-4 cycles      → "Assessing" status shown
5+ cycles       → Full assessment available
6+ months       → CRITICAL: Full analysis unlocked
```

**What You See:**

**Phase 1: Assessing (< 6 months)**
```
Cycle Regularity
"Assessment in progress. Please track for 6 months 
to get accurate cycle regularity assessment. 
You have 2.3 months of data (need 6 months). 
Check back in approximately 106 days."
```

**Phase 2: Accurate (6+ months)**
```
Cycle Regularity
"Cycle length is stable and consistent (StdDev: 3.2 days). 
Your cycles align well with healthy patterns.
(6.2 months tracked - 6 cycles - High confidence)"
```

---

## Weight Tracking Requirements

### Weight Logs - QUICK RESULTS (3+ logs)

**Minimum:** 3 weight entries  
**Better:** 5+ weight entries  
**Optimal:** Continuous tracking

**Timeline:**
```
1 weight log   → Baseline set
3 weight logs  → Variance calculation starts (contributes to risk score)
5+ logs        → Accurate trend analysis
```

**What Triggers:**
```
< 3 entries    → Skipped (not enough data)
3+ entries     → Weight Stability factor activates (20% of risk)
5+ entries     → More accurate variance calculation
```

**Analysis Window:**
- Uses most recent 5 weight entries
- Calculates variance/stability
- Detects fluctuations (±2kg, ±3-6kg, >6kg)

---

## Hydration Tracking Requirements

### Hydration Logs - 7 DAYS NEEDED

**Minimum:** 7 hydration entries (one week)  
**Better:** 14+ entries (two weeks)  
**Optimal:** Daily tracking

**Timeline:**
```
1-6 logs       → Skipped (not enough data)
7 logs         → Hydration factor activates (10% of risk)
14+ logs       → More accurate trend
30+ logs       → Monthly average calculation
```

**What Gets Analyzed:**
- Last 7 days of hydration data
- Calculates daily average
- Compares to 2000-3000ml recommended

**Impact Thresholds:**
```
< 1200 ml/day  → High severity
1200-1800 ml   → Moderate severity
2000-3000 ml   → Optimal
```
