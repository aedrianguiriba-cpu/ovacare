## Understanding Your Data

### What Each Symptom Means (Medical Context)

**Cramps**
- Related to menstrual cycle and prostaglandin levels
- Higher severity may indicate hormonal issues
- Tracking helps identify patterns

**Acne/Skin Issues**
- Associated with hormonal imbalances
- Common PCOS symptom (affects 20-40% of PCOS patients)
- Increased androgen levels contribute

**Bloating**
- Related to hormonal fluctuations
- Common before/during menstruation
- PCOS patients often report increased bloating

**Excessive Hair Growth (Hirsutism)**
- Sign of elevated androgen levels
- Strong PCOS indicator (occurs in 70% of PCOS patients)
- Important symptom to track

**Irregular Period**
- Primary PCOS indicator
- Cycles longer than 35 days or missing periods
- Critical diagnostic marker

**Mood Changes**
- Can be related to hormonal fluctuations
- Helps identify PMS-related mood swings
- Important for mental health correlation

### Spotting Patterns

**Look for:**
1. **Clustering** - Do severe symptoms happen on the same days?
2. **Cycles** - Do symptoms repeat in a pattern?
3. **Triggers** - Do certain moods correlate with physical symptoms?
4. **Trends** - Are symptoms getting better or worse?

**Example Pattern:**
```
Jan 5:  Cramps=5, Bloating=Yes, Mood=Tired → Summary shows pattern
Jan 12: Cramps=4, Bloating=Yes, Mood=Anxious → Bloating consistent
Jan 19: Cramps=6, Bloating=Yes, Mood=Tired → Pattern confirms
Action: Discuss bloating pattern with doctor
```

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have all the symptoms?**
A: Only check the symptoms you actually have. It's normal to have some but not all.

**Q: Can I edit past entries?**
A: Currently, entries are logged as-is. Delete by swiping if needed, then re-log if changes are needed.

**Q: How far back should I log?**
A: Ideal: 2-3 full cycles (2-3 months). This gives enough data to see patterns.

**Q: Should I log every day?**
A: Yes, even "no symptoms" days provide valuable data for your doctor.

**Q: What's the difference between Severity (1-5) and Cramps (0-10)?**
A: Severity = overall feeling that day. Cramps = specific pain level. Both together give complete picture.

**Q: Why track hair growth and irregular period?**
A: These are primary PCOS indicators. Tracking them helps you and your doctor identify potential PCOS.

A: Look for export feature in menu. Coming soon for PDF/email sharing with doctors.
